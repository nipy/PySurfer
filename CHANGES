PySurfer Changes
================

Version 0.6
-----------

- Values that were previously selected using a ``config_opts``
  dictionary in the ``Brain`` constructor are now keyword arguments.
  This should make it easier to use tab-completion in IPython, and will
  generally simplify your scripts. To ease transition, a ``config_opts``
  argument will still be caught, and its entries will be used (overriding
  the keyword arguments), but it will be removed in a future release.
- The ability to set default values in a config file has been removed.
  While convenient, this approach encourages code that is not fully
  reproducible. While existing code that was written expecting a config
  file will still run, the visualization will fall back to default values.
  These should be updated directly in your plotting scripts.
- Figure size is now specified only through the ``size`` keyword argument
  of :class:`Brain`. To make a rectangular window, pass a ``(width, height)``
  tuple. Passing a single value to ``size`` will still make a square window.
- The ``cortex`` keyword argument can now be a mayavi colormap name or
  a ``(colormap, min, max, reverse)`` tuple for full control.
- Morphometry plotting was made more flexible with the ability to pass
  a specific colormap and anchor points for that colormap. Additionally,
  the default anchor points now use robust statistics to give better
  values.
- Contour overlay plotting was made more flexible by adding keyword arguments
  to control whether a colorbar should be shown and whether existing contour
  overlays should be removed before plotting.

Version 0.5
-----------

- Added control over the width of outlines when plotting the borders of
  annotations or labels.
- The visual display of the surfaces was improved by using surface normals.
- Made colormap specification in Brain.add_data and Brain.add_contour_overlay
  more flexible, with better defaults.
- Brain.save_montage() can now produce 2d grids of views in addition to
  horizontal and vertical arrangements. 
- Fixed some installation issues and added explicit checks for dependencies
  on install.
- Updated the installation docs with information about getting PySurfer
  running on OSX, and changed the official environment recommendation to
  Anaconda.

Version 0.4
-----------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Display data from both hemispheres simultaneously
- Display multiple views simultaneously
- Toggling Mayavi toolbars
- Use nibabel for IO functions

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

- Reverted change in io.py that broke Python 2.6 compatibility
- Updated traitsui import while keeping backgrounds compatibility

Version 0.3
-----------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- TimeViewer GUI to control data exploration in the time dimension
- Support for reading and visualizing MEG data from MNE
- Function to project volume-based data using mri_vol2surf
- Label routines can read scalar data and threshold visualization
- Utility function to smooth overlay data along the cortical manifold
- Example for displaying parcellation-based ROI analysis results
- Example for displaying ROI labels
- Example for plotting probabilistic labels
- Improved color flexibility using matplotlib for many visualization modes
- Exposed alpha channel for many visualization modes

Fixes
~~~~~

- Big-endian overlay data should now display properly on 64-bit systems.
- Colorbar text displays properly on light backgrounds
- Lights are oriented depending on hemisphere so surfaces are equally lit
