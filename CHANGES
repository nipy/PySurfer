PySurfer Changes
================

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Brain.data is now a list of dictionaries, and Brain.add_data takes
  an optional argument `keep_existing` that avoids removing previous
  data surfaces when True. Note that this breaks API with respect to the
  Brain.data attribute, which was previously a single dictionary.
- Added example showing how to create a "dual encode" visualization
  that shows effect size with the color map and reliability with the
  opacity of the overlay.

Fixes
~~~~~

- More robust/clean fix to Mayavi endian issues that sometimes
  cause strange display of scalar overlay data

Version 0.3.1
-------------

Fixes
~~~~~

- Reverted change in io.py that broke Python 2.6 compatibility
- Updated traitsui import while keeping backgrounds compatibility

Version 0.3
-----------

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- TimeViewer GUI to control data exploration in the time dimension
- Support for reading and visualizing MEG data from MNE
- Function to project volume-based data using mri_vol2surf
- Label routines can read scalar data and threshold visualization
- Utility function to smooth overlay data along the cortical manifold
- Example for displaying parcellation-based ROI analysis results
- Example for displaying ROI labels
- Example for plotting probabilistic labels
- Improved color flexibility using matplotlib for many visualization modes
- Exposed alpha channel for many visualization modes

Fixes
~~~~~

- Big-endian overlay data should now display properly on 64-bit systems.
- Colorbar text displays properly on light backgrounds
- Lights are oriented depending on hemisphere so surfaces are equally lit
