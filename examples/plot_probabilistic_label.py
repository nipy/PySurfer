Display Probabilistic Labels
============================

Freesurfer ships with some probabilistic labels of cytoarchitectonic
and visual areas. Here we show several ways to visualize these labels
to help characterize the location of your data.

Show the morphometry with a continuous grayscale colormap.
"""
brain.add_morphometry("curv", colormap="binary",
                      min=-.8, max=.8, colorbar=False)

"""
The easiest way to label any vertex that could be in the region is with
add_label.
"""
brain.add_label("BA1", color="#A6BDDB")

"""
You can also threshold based on the probability of that region being at each
vertex.
"""
brain.add_label("BA1", color="#2B8CBE", scalar_thresh=.5)

"""
It's also possible to plot just the label boundary, in case you wanted to
overlay the label on an activation plot to asses whether it falls within that
region.
"""
brain.add_label("BA45", color="#F0F8FF", borders=3, scalar_thresh=.5)
brain.add_label("BA45", color="#F0F8FF", alpha=.3, scalar_thresh=.5)

Finally, with a few tricks, you can display the whole probabilistic map.

# When a patch's was loaded (e.g. cortex.patch.flat), brain.geo['lh'] describes
# the patch's vertices, not the original surface's vertices. The following

# also applies the same filtering to 'probs'. Note that some vertices might be 
# present only in the original surface.
