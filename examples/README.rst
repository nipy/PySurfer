PySurfer Examples
=================

This directory contains a set of example scripts intended to demonstrate the
functionality offered by PySurfer, from the most basic tasks to more complicated
visualizations. It also serves as a test suite for the visualization module,
which is difficult to test numerically.

Any example with a filename that begins with ``plot`` will be executed when
the documentation is built, with any figures build during execution captured
and saved in the html file.

The automatic doc engine writes an example index by the alphabetical filename,
and the general intention is to move from basic examples to more complex tasks.
Please keep this in mind when naming example scripts.

Contributions are more than welcome!
