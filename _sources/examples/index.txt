.. _examples-index:


This page offers a set of example scripts intended to demonstrate the
functionality offered by PySurfer, from the most basic tasks to more complex 
visualizations. 

For each script that produces a figure, the image is automatically captured
and displayed along with the code that generated it.

Used PySurfer to present neuroimaging data in a way that isn't covered here?
Please contribute_ it!
