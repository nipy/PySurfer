Working with a split-screen brain
=================================

The split-screen view can be activated by using the argument ``hemi='split'``.
Using this option will put views of the left hemisphere in consecutive
vertical frames on the left, and views of the right hemisphere in
consecutive vertical frames on the right. For example, running the following::

    brain = Brain('fsaverage', 'split', 'inflated', views=['lat', 'med'])

Will produce a window with two columns (hemispheres) and two rows (the
lateral and medial views, respectively), shown below.

Adding and displaying data
--------------------------

Data can be added to either hemisphere using the same functions that are
normally used, e.g. ``add_data``, ``add_overlay``, ``add_morphometry``.
The objects are automatically shown on all views of the brain. When
calling these functions, the ``hemi`` keyword argument can be set to
``hemi='lh'`` or ``hemi='rh'`` to specify the hemisphere to plot to.
In some instances (e.g., ``add_morphometry``), if no keyword argument
is provided, PySurfer will attempt to load data or both hemispheres
automtically.

Note that the ``show_view`` method accepts arguments for the ``row`` and
``col`` values, which allow the user to control which ``Brain`` panel
gets the updated view.

Caveats
-------
The multi-view support is available thanks to the capabilities of the
TraitsUI framework. However, due to some limitations in the implementation
of TraitsUI, there is no guarantee that a set of scripted commands will
result in a painted window when the user may think it will. For
example, making a series of calls to ``brain.add_label()`` followed by
``brain.save_image('out.png')`` may result in some or all of the labels
being absent from the saved ``out.png``. While we have implemented some
workarounds to help prevent this occurrance, we cannot guarantee it will
work. Thus we recommend that for critical non-interactive plotting (e.g.,
if scripting figure generation for a paper) only a single view is used
with ``hemi`` set to ``'lh'``, ``'rh'``, or ``'both'``. This will use a single,
pure Mayavi window, thereby bypassing TraisUI entirely -- this helps
guarantee that drawing commands result in updated visual display.
