Introduction
============

PySurfer is a Python based program for visualization and interaction
with cortical surface representations of neuroimaging data from
`Freesurfer <http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>`_. It extends
`Mayavi's <http://github.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/index.html>`_ powerful
visualization engine with a high-level interface for working with
MRI and MEG data.

PySurfer offers both a command-line interface designed to broadly
replicate Freesurfer's Tksurfer program as well as a Python library
for writing scripts to efficiently explore complex datasets.
