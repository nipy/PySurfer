Installation and Dependencies
=============================

Installing PySurfer is quite simple with easy_install_::

    easy_install -U pysurfer

or pip_::

    pip install pysurfer

To use PySurfer, you will need to have the following Python packages:

* numpy_
* scipy_
* ipython_
* nibabel_
* mayavi_
* matplotlib_
* PIL_

An easy option to get all of these packages is to use the Enthought
Python Distribution (EPD_) which is free for academic use.

Notice. For optimal results and performance make sure IPython is invoked using the specfic back end the visualization libraries PySurfer depends on were compiled against.  
In an EPD environment on Mac OS X this would be WX, so `ipython --pylab wx`. On Linux Debian / Ubuntu (Neurodebian) QT seems to be appropriate, so `ipython --pylab qt`. Reports for other platforms and distributions are appreciated.
